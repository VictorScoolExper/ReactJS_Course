JSX Limitations

You can't return more than one "root" JSX element (you also can't store more than one "root" JSX element in a variable)
The solution is to ALWAYS WRAP adjacent elements.
NOTE: that it does not have to be a div.
We can return an array of jsx elements but it requires components to have keys.

The problem with using div is creating "<div> Soup"
In bigger apps you can easily end up with TONS OR UNNECESARY <div>s (or other elements) which
add NO SEMANTIC MEANING OR STRUCTURE to the page but ARE ONLY THERE BECAUSE OF REACT's/JSX REQUIREMENT
Fragment is also an alternative

Understanding React Portals:
For certain situations the way react renders the element to the dom.
For example:
SEMANTICALLY and from a "clean HTML structure" perspective, having this nested modal isn't ideal. It is an 
OVERLAY TO THE ENTIRE PAGE after all (that's similiar for side-drawers, other dialogs etc.)

files affected:
- Helpers/Wrapper.js
- Users/AddUser.js
