What to validate in a form?
- When the form is submitted
    - Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning him/her
    - Avoid unnecessary warnings but maybe present feedback "too late"
-  When the input is losing focus
    - Allows the user to enter a valid value before warning him/her
    - Very useful for untouched forms
- on every keystroke
    - Warns user before he/she had a chance of entering valid values.
    - if applied only on invalid inputs, has the potential of providing more direct feedback
